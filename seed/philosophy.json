      "arguments": [
        "Consciousness is fundamental to experience and cannot be reduced to physical processes",
        "The hard problem of consciousness shows the explanatory gap between brain states and subjective experience",
        "Consciousness exhibits unity and intentionality that distinguishes it from mere information processing"
      ],
      "counterArguments": [
        "Consciousness emerges from complex neural activity and can be explained through materialism",
        "Neuroscience shows that consciousness can be altered by brain changes, suggesting physical basis",

        "Virtue ethics focuses on character development rather than just actions"
      ],
      "counterArguments": [
        "Moral relativism suggests that ethical principles vary across cultures and contexts",
        "Evolutionary explanations show that moral intuitions may be biological rather than rational",

      "arguments": [
        "We have direct experience of making free choices in our daily lives",
        "Moral responsibility requires that our actions be freely chosen",
        "Quantum indeterminacy provides room for genuine choice in a physical world"
      ],
      "counterArguments": [
        "Causal determinism suggests that all events, including human actions, are the result of prior causes",
        "Neuroscience shows that brain activity precedes conscious decision-making",
        "Random events are not the same as free choices, so indeterminacy doesn't help"

        "Being-in-the-world is the fundamental structure of human existence",
        "Authentic existence requires confronting anxiety and taking responsibility for our choices"
      ],
      "counterArguments": [
        "Essence precedes existence - things have inherent natures that determine their existence",
        "Existence is simply a property that some things have and others lack",
        "Scientific materialism provides a complete account of existence without existentialist concepts"
